\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
A finite automaton (FA) is a model of computation with applications in different branches of computer science, e.g., compiler design, formal verification, 
designing of digital circuits or natural language processing. In formal verification alone are its uses abundant, 
for example in model checking of safety temporal properties, abstract regular model checking \cite{armc}, static analysis \cite{metal}, 
or decision procedures of some logics, such as Presburger arithmetic or weak 
monadic second-order theory of one successor (WS1S) \cite{mona}.

Many of the mentioned applications need to perform certain expensive operations on FA, such as checking universality of an FA (i.e., checking whether it
accepts any word over a given alphabet), or checking language inclusion of a pair of FA (i.e., testing whether the language of one FA is a subset of the language
of the second FA). The Classical (so called \emph{textbook}) approach is based on \emph{complementation} of the language of an FA. Complementation is easy for 
\emph{deterministic} FA (DFA)--just swapping accepting and non-accepting states--but a hard problem for \emph{nondeterministic} FA (NFA), which need 
to be determinised first (this may lead to an exponential explosion in the number of the states of the automaton). 
Both operations of checking of universality and language inclusion over NFA are PSPACE-complete problems \cite{cav06}.

Recently, there has been a considerable advance in techniques for dealing with these problems. The new techniques are either based on the so-called 
\emph{antichains} \cite{cav06,tacas10} or the so-called \emph{bisimulation up to congruence} \cite{popl13}. 
In general, those techniques do not need an explicit construction of the complement
automaton. They only construct a sub-automaton which is sufficient for either proving that the universality or inclusion hold, or finding a counterexample.

Unfortunately, there is currently no efficient implementation of a general NFA library that would use the state-of-the-art algorithms for the mentioned
operations on automata. The
closest implementation is VATA \cite{libvata}, a general library for nondeterministic finite \emph{tree} automata, which can be used even for NFA (being modelled 
as unary tree automata) but not with the optimal performance given by its overhead that comes with the ability to handle much richer structures. 
 
The goal of this work is two-fold: (i) extending VATA with an NFA module implementing basic operations on NFA, such as union, intersection, or 
checking language inclusion, and (ii) an efficient design and implementation of checking language inclusion of NFA using 
bisimulation up to congruence (which is missing in VATA for tree automata).

After this introduction, in the \ref{teorie}nd chapter of this document, 
will be defined theoretical background. The \ref{chapInclusion}rd chapter will describe efficient approaches to language inclusion testing.
Existing libraries for finite automata manipulation and the VATA library will be introduced in chapter \ref{libraries}. 
Design of extension for VATA 
will take place in chapter \ref{arch}. Implementation and optimization is possible to find in chapter \ref{implementation}. Evaluation will be
described in chapter \ref{eval} and final conclusion in chapter \ref{concl}.
\chapter{Finite Automata and Languages}
This chapter contains theoretical fundations of the thesis. No proofs are given, because they can be found in literature. 
%TODO dodelat
First, the finite automaton and their context will be defined, then the language, regular language and its closure properties and at last conversion from
NFA to DFA with subset construction.

\section{Languages}
We call a finite set of symbols $\Sigma$ an \emph{alphabet}. A~\emph{word} $w$ over $\Sigma$ of \emph{length} $n$ is a finite sequence of symbols 
$w=a_1\ldots a_n$, where $\forall 1 \leq i \leq n\ . \ a_i \in \Sigma$. An \emph{empty word} is denoted as $\epsilon \not\in\Sigma$ and its length is $0$. 
We define \emph{concatenation} as an associative binary operation on words over $\Sigma$ represented by the symbol $\cdot$ such that for two words $u=a_1\ldots a_2$
and $v=b_1\ldots b_n$ over $\Sigma$ it holds that $\epsilon\cdot u=u\cdot\epsilon=u$ and $u\cdot v=a_1 \ldots a_nb_1 \ldots b_m$.
We define a symbol $\Sigma^{*}$ as a set of all words over $\Sigma$ including the empty word and a symbol $\Sigma^{+}$ as a set of 
all words over $\Sigma$ without the empty word, 
so it holds that $\Sigma_{*}=\Sigma_{+}\cup\epsilon$. A~\emph{language} $L$ over $\Sigma$ is subset of $\Sigma^{*}$.
Given a pair of languages $L_1$ over an alphabet $\Sigma_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ over an alphabet $\Sigma_{2}$. Their concatenation is defined by 
$L_1\cdot L_2=\{x\cdot y\ |\ x\in L_1, y\in L_2 \}$.
We define \emph{iteration} and \emph{positive} iteration of a language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ \emph{iteration} as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $L^0=\{\epsilon\}$
		\item $L^{n+1}=L\cdot L^n$, for $n \leq 1$
    \item $L^{*}=\bigcup_{n\leq 0} L^{n}$
    \item $L^{+}=\bigcup_{n\leq 1} L^{n}$
	\end{itemize}

\section{Finite Automata}
\label{defFA}

	\subsection{Nondeterministic Finite Automaton}
	\label{defNFA}
		\emph{A Nondeterministic Finite Automaton} (NFA) is a quintuple $N=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,I,F)$, where
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $Q$ is a finite set of states,
			\item $\Sigma$ is an alphabet,
			\item $\delta \subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q$ is a transition relation. We use $p \xrightarrow{a} q$ to denote that $(p,a,q)\in\delta$,
			\item $I$ is finite set of states, that $I \subseteq Q$. Elements of $I$ are called initial states.
			\item $F$ is finite set of states, that $F \subseteq Q$. Elements of $F$ are called final states.
		\end{itemize}

    An example of an NFA is shown on the picture \label{pic_ex_nfa}.

	\subsection{Deterministic Finite Automaton}
	\label{defDFA}
  A~\emph{deterministic finite automaton} (DFA) is a special case of an NFA, where $\delta$ is a partial function 
$\delta: Q\times \Sigma \to Q$ and $|I| \leq 1$. To be precise, we give the whole definition of DFA.\newline
\newline
		A DFA is a quintuple $N=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,I,F)$ where
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $Q$ is a finite set of states,
			\item $\Sigma$ is  an alphabet,
			\item $\delta$:  $Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ is a partial transition function. We use $p \xrightarrow{a} q$ to denote that $\delta(p,a)=q$
			\item $I\subseteq Q$ is finite set of initial states, that $|I| \leq 1$.
			\item $F\subseteq Q$ is finite set of final states.
		\end{itemize}
    An example of a DFA is given on the picture \ref{pic_ex_dfa}.

	\subsection{Run of Finite Automaton}
	\label{defRun}
	\begin{definition}
		\emph{A run of the finite automaton }$A$ over a finite word $\omega=\sigma_1\dots\sigma_n$ is a sequence $r=q_0\dots q_n$ of states such that
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $q_0\in I$
			\item $\delta(q_i,\sigma_{i+1})=q_{i+1}$, for all $0\leq i < n$
		\end{itemize}\
		Run is called \emph{accepting} if $q_n\in F$.
	\end{definition}

	\subsection{Accepting Word}
	\label{defAWord}
	\begin{definition}
		\emph{Accepting} word is $\omega \in \Sigma^{*}$, if there exists \emph{accepting} run for $\omega$.

	\begin{definition}
		If there is no run $r=q_0\ldots q_n$ of the finite automaton $A$ over word $\omega \in \Sigma^{*}$, where $q_0\in I$, then $q_n$ is \emph{unreachable} state.

	\subsection{State equivalence}
	\label{defStateEq}
	\begin{definition}
		Let have DFA $A$. States $p \in Q$ and $q \in Q$ are equivalent, if this condition is satisfied:
		\begin{description}
			\item $\forall \omega \in \Sigma^{*}: \emph{ Run from } p \emph{ over } \omega \emph{ is accepting} \Leftrightarrow 
			\emph{ Run from } q \emph{ over } \omega \emph{ is accepting}$
		\end{description}
	\end{definition}

	\label{defMinDFA}
	\begin{definition}
		Minimum DFA satisfies this conditions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There are no unreachable states
			\item There is maximal one nonterminating state, what is nonaccepting state, that for each input symbol terminates on itself.
			\item Equivalent states are collapsed.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}


	\subsection{Automata Union}
	\label{defAUnion}
	\begin{definition}
		$A=(Q_A,\Sigma,\delta_A,I_A,F_A)$ and $B=(Q_B,\Sigma,\delta_B,I_B,F_B)$ are two NFA's. Their union is defined by
		\begin{description}

\section{Languages}
		\subsection{Language Accepted by Finite Automaton $M$}
		\label{defLangM}
		\begin{definition}
			\emph{The language accepted by finite automaton $M$} is the set of all strings accepted by $M$ and is denoted as $L(M)$:
			\begin{description}
				\item $L(M) = \{\omega\in\Sigma^{*}\ |\ \emph{there exists an accepting run for }\omega\emph{ in }L\}$
			\end{description}
		\end{definition}
		\begin{definition}
			$L(M)(p)$ is language of state $p$ from finite automaton $M$.
			\begin{description}
				\item $L(M)(p) = \{\omega\in\Sigma^{*}\ |\ \emph{there exists an accepting run of }M\emph{ over }\omega\emph{ in }L,\emph{ which starts in state }p\}$
			\end{description}
		\end{definition}
		\subsection{Regular Language}
		\begin{definition}
			A language $L$ is \emph{regular}, if exists some finite automaton $M$,\\ that $L=L(M)$.
		\end{definition}

		\subsection{Closure Properties of Regular Languages}
		\label{defClose}
		Regular languages are closed under certain operation, if result of this operation on some regular language is always regular language too.

		Let introduce the closure properties of regular languages on alphabet $\Sigma$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Union:  $L_1 \cup L_2=\{x\ |\ x \in L_1 \vee x\in L_2\}$
			\item Intersection:  $L_1 \cap L_2=\{x\ |\ x \in L_1 \wedge x\in L_2\}$
			\item Complement: $\overline{L}=\{x\ |\ x\not\in L\}$
			\item Difference: $L-K=\{x\ |\ x\in L \wedge x\not\in K\}$
			\item Reversal: $L^R = \{y\ |\ x=a_1\dots a_n \in L \Rightarrow y=a_n\dots a_1\}$
			\item Kleen closure (star): $L^{*}$ is defined as:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $L_0=\{\epsilon\}$, where epsilon is empty string
				\item $L_1=\{a\}$, where $a\in \Sigma$
				\item $L_{i+1}=\{wv\ |\ w\in L_i \wedge v \in \Sigma\}$, where $i>0$
			\end{itemize}
			\item Concatenation: $LK=\{xy\ |\ x\in L \wedge y\in K\}$
			\item Homomorphism: $h$ is homomorphism on alphabet $\Sigma$ of language $L$.

$h(L)=\{h(x)\ |\ x \in L\}$
			\item Inverse homomorphism: $h$ is homomorphism on alphabet $\Sigma$ of language $L$.

$h^{-1}(L)=\{x\ |\ h(x) \in L\}$
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Language inclusion}
		\label{defIncl}
		\begin{definition}
		Let have language of finite automaton $A$ and language of finite automata $B$. Inclusion of this two languages is defined as:
		\begin{description}
			$L(A)\cap \overline{L(B)} = \varnothing$
		\end{description}
		\end{definition}

	\section{Subset construction}
	\label{subset}
	Now we will define how to construct equivalent DFA $A_{det}$ for a given NFA $A=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,S,F)$. 
	This classical ("textbook") approach is called \emph{subset construction}.
	\begin{definition}
	\label{defSubset}
		$A_{det}=(2^Q,\Sigma,\delta_{det},S,F_{det})$, where
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $2^Q$ is power set of $Q$
			\item $F_{det}=\{Q'\subseteq Q\ |\ Q'\cap F \not = \varnothing\}$
			\item $\delta_{det}(Q',a)=\bigcup\limits_{q\in Q'}\delta(q,a)$, where $a\in\Sigma$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}

\chapter{Inclusion Checking of NFA}
\label{chapInclusion}
\emph{Language inclusion problem} is decision whether $L(A) \subseteq L(B)$. 
This problem is\\ PSPACE-complete \cite{cav06}. For decision of \emph{language inclusion problem} exists some classical algorithms.
Classical algorithms are based on searching of accepting state of product automaton $A\times \overline{B}$. Such state can serve like \emph{witness}, that
there is no inclusion between $A$ and $B$. Problem of classical (textbook) algorithm is that they are based on explicit determinisation of automaton $B$ 
via \emph{subset construction}. Of course, if \emph{witness} state is found, algorithm ends, but very often whole DFA is build, what leads to state explosion.
But many of states are not in fact necessary for inclusion testing. 

In this work are used two approaches, which do not need explicit determinisation of NFA, 
first uses \emph{antichains and simulations} \cite{cav06,tacas10} for pruning states of NFA and second uses \emph{bisimulation up to congruence} \cite{popl13}.

Let denote product state as pair $(p,P)$, where $p\in A \wedge P \in B$ 

For these algorithms we have to define post-image of product state of automaton $A\times B$:\
\begin{definition}
$Post((p,P)):=\{(p',P')\ |\ \exists a \in \Sigma: (p,a,p')\in \delta, P'=\{p''\ |\ \exists p \in P:(p,a,p'')\in \delta\}\}$
\end{definition}

\section{Checking Inclusion with Antichains and Simulation}
First approach uses optimized method based on combination of \emph{antichains with simulation} from \cite{tacas10}.
Firstly, let define the antichain and simulation (\cite{simulations}).
\begin{definition}
\label{defAntichains}
	Let $S$ be a \emph{partially order} set. Two elements $a,b\in S$ are incomparable iff $neither\ a \leq b, nor\ b \leq a$.
	An \emph{antichain} is a set $A \subseteq S$, where
	\begin{description}	
		\item $A \subseteq S =\{\forall a,b \in A\ .\ a\not\in b \cap b \not a\}$. 
	\end{description}	
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
\label{defSimulation}
		A forward \emph{simulation} on NFA $A=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,I,F)$ is a relation $\preceq\  \subseteq Q \times Q$ such that $p \preceq r$ iff (i) $p \in F 
		\Rightarrow r \in F$ and (ii) for every transition $p \xrightarrow{a} p'$, there exists a transition $r \xrightarrow{a} r'$ such that $p' \preceq r'$ 
\end{definition}

%Let denote $A^{\subseteq}$ as the set of relations over automaton $A$ that imply inclusion,\\ so if $\preceq \in A^{\subseteq}$, 
%then $p\preceq r \Rightarrow L(A)(p) \subseteq L(A)(r)$.
%
For two macro-states $P$ and $R$ of some automaton is $P\preceq^{\forall\exists}R$ shorthand\\ for $\forall p\in P.\exists r \in R: p \preceq r$

Product state (p,P) is accepting, if $p$ is accepting in automaton $A$ and $P$ is rejecting in automaton $B$.

Pseudocode of \emph{antichain} approach is algorithm \ref{algAntichain}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\label{algAntichain}
	\KwIn{NFA's $\mathcal{A}=(Q_A,\Sigma,\delta_A,S_A,F_A),\ \mathcal{B}=(Q_B,\Sigma,\delta_B,S_B,F_B)$.\\ 
	 A relation $\preceq \in (\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B})^{\subseteq}$.}
	\KwOut{TRUE if $\mathcal{L(A)}\subseteq\mathcal{L(B)}$. Otherwise, FALSE.}
		\If{there is an accepting product-state in \{$(s,S_{\mathcal{B}})|s\in S_{\mathcal{A}}$\}}
			{return FALSE\;}
		Processed:=$\varnothing$\;
		Next:= Initialize(\{$(s,Minimize(S_B))\mid s\in S_A$\})\;
		\While{($Next\neq \varnothing$)}
		{
			Pick and remove a product-state $(r,R)$ from Next and move it to Processed\;
			\ForAll{$(p,P)\in \{(r',Minimize(R'))\mid (r',R')\in Post((r,R))\}$}
			{
				\eIf{$(p,P)$ is an accepting product-state}
				{
					\Return FALSE\;}
					{
						\If{$\not{\exists}p'\in P\ s.t.\ p\preceq p'$}
						{
							\If{$\not{\exists} (x,X) \in Processed\cup Next\ s.t.\ p\preceq x \wedge X\preceq^{\forall \exists}P$}
							{
							 Remove all $(x,X)$ from $Processed\cup Next\ s.t.\ x\preceq p \wedge P\preceq^{\forall \exists}X$\;
							 Add $(p,P)$ to Next\;
							}
						}
				 }
		  }
		}
		\Return TRUE;
	\caption{Language inclusion checking with antichains and simulations}
\end{algorithm}\
\\
Let describe two optimization use in algorithm \ref{algAntichain} based on \cite{tacas10}. First optimization comes from the observation that
we can stop search from product-state $(p,P)$, if there exists some visited product state $(r,R)$, 
such that $p\preceq r \wedge R\preceq^{\forall\exists}P$, or $\exists p'\in P: p \preceq p'$. First part of condition says that 
if $(p,P)$ takes automaton to the accepting state, $(r,R)$ will be taken to accepting state too, so we do not have search from $(p,P)$. Second part of condition
shows, that every accepting word of $p$ takes $P$ to accepting state too, because $\exists p'\in P: p \preceq p'$.
Proof for this can be found in \cite{tacas10}. This first
optimization is in algorithm \ref{algAntichain} at lines 11--14.

Second optimization is based on fact, that $L(A)(P)=L(A)(P-\{p_1\})$, if there exists $p_2$, such as $p_1 \preceq p_2$. We can remove the state $p_1$ 
from macro-state $P$, because if $L(A)(P)$ rejects the word, then $L(A)(P-\{p_1\})$ rejects this word too. This optimization is applied in function $Minimize$ at
lines 4 and 7 in algorithm \ref{algAntichain}. Proof for this optimization is again in \cite{tacas10}.

\section{Checking Inclusion with Bisimulation up to Congruence}
	Checking inclusion with using \emph{bisimulation up to congruence} is based on \emph{Hopcroft and Karp's} algorithm. Congruence 
	algorithm serves for checking language equivalence, but it can
	be used also for checking language inclusion. Indeed, let $X$ and $Y$ be sets of states of NFA's. 
	So $X \cup Y= Y$,
	iff $X \subseteq Y $. It is possible to check equivalence for $X+Y$ and $Y$ \cite{popl13}.

	Before introduction of the algorithm itself, we will define \emph{congruence} relation.
	\begin{definition}
		Let $X$ be a set with n-ary operation $O$ over $X$. \emph{Congruence} is an equivalence relation $R$, 
	which follows this condition $\forall a_1,\ldots,a_n,b_1,\ldots,b_n\in X$:
		\begin{description}
			\item $a_1 \sim_{R} b_1,\ldots,a_n \sim_{R} b_n \Rightarrow O_n(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \sim_{R} O_n(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$,
		\end{description}
		where $a_i \in X, b_i \in X$
	\end{definition}

	Optimized algorithm uses \emph{congruence closure function} $c$ for pruning out the unnecessary states for checking equivalence.
	Pseudocode is algorithm \ref{algCongr}.\\
	\newline
	\begin{algorithm}[h]
		\label{algCongr}
		\KwIn{NFA's $A=(Q_A,\Sigma,\delta_A,s_A,F_A),\ B=(Q_B,\Sigma,\delta_B,s_B,F_B)$.} 
		\KwOut{TRUE, if $L(A)$ and $L(B)$ are in equivalence relation. Otherwise, FALSE.}
			$Processed = \varnothing$\;
			$Next = \varnothing$\;
			insert($s_A$,$s_B$) into $Next$\;
			\While{$Next \neq \varnothing$}
			{
				extract($x$,$y$) from $Next$\;
				\If {$x$,$y \in c(Processed \cup Next)$}
				{skip\;}
				\If{$(x \in F_A \Leftrightarrow y \in F_B)$}
				{
					\Return FALSE\;
				}
				%\ForAll {$a\in \Sigma$}
				%{
					insert($post(x,y)$) in $Next$\;
				%}
				insert($x$,$y$) in $Processed$\;
			}
			\Return TRUE;

\chapter{Existing Finite Automata Libraries and VATA library} %TODO: zvazit zobecneni na prehled existujicich knihoven
\label{libraries}
There are many different libraries for finite automata. Libraries have various purposes and 
are implemented in different languages. 
At this chapter, some libraries will be described. Described libraries are just examples, which represents typical disadvantages of existing libraries, like
classical approach for language inclusion testing, which needs determinisation of finite automaton. 

As the second VATA library for manipulating of \emph{tree} automata will be introduced. It will be briefly describe library design, operations for \emph{tree}
automata and plans for extension of VATA \emph{library}.

\section{Existing Finite Automata Libraries}
\label{existinglibraries}
\subsection{dk.brics.automaton}
\label{brics}
\emph{dk.brics.automaton} is established Java package available under BSD license. Last version of this library (1.11-8) was released on September 7th, 2011.
Library can be downloaded and more information are on \cite{brics}. 

Library can use as input regular expression created by Java class \emph{RegeExp}.
It supports manipulation with NFA and DFA. Basic operation like union,
intersection, complementation or run of automaton on the given word etc., are available.

Test of language inclusion is also supported, but if the input automaton is NFA, it needs to be converted to DFA. 
This is made by \emph{subset construction} approach, which is inefficient \cite{cav06}, \cite{tacas10}.

\emph{dk.brics.automaton} was ported to another two languages in two different libraries, which will be described next.

\subsubsection{libfa}
\emph{libfa} is implemented in C. \emph{libfa} is part
of \emph{Augeas} tool. Library is licensed under the LGPL, version 2 or later. It also support both versions of Finite Automata, NFA and DFA. 
Regular expressions could serve like input again.
\emph{libfa} can be found and downloaded on \cite{libfa}.
\emph{libfa} has no explicit operation for inclusion checking, but has operations for intersect and complement of automata, which can serve for inclusion checking.
Main disadvantage of libfa is again need of determinisation.

\subsubsection{Fare}
\emph{Fare} is library, which brings \emph{dk.brics.automaton} from Java to .NET. 
This library has same characteristics like \emph{dk.brics.automaton} or \emph{libfa} and disadvantage in need of determinisation is still here. 
\emph{Fare} can be found on \cite{fare}

\subsection{The RWHT FSA toolkit}
The RWHT FSA is toolkit for manipulating finite automata described in \cite{kanthakN04}. The latest version is 0.9.4 from year 2005. Toolkit is written in C++
and available under its special license, derived from Q Public License v1.0 and the Qt Non-Commercial License v1.0. Library can be downloaded from \cite{rwth}. 

Library supports on-demand computation for better memory efficiency. Another advantage is, that it supports the weighted transitions, so it is possible to use it
for wider range of applications. The RWHT FSA toolkit does not support the explicitly directly, but contains operations for intersection, complement and
determinisation, which are unnecessary for inclusion testing. There are used some optimization, but this not compensates need of 
determinisation. 

\subsection{Implementation of New Efficient Algorithms}
New efficient algorithms for inclusion testing, which were introduced in \cite{cav06,tacas10} and \cite{popl13}, was implemented for finite automata 
only in OCaml for testing and evaluation purposes. But implementation in C++ could be much more efficient.

The algorithm based on antichains and simulation introduced in \cite{taca10} have been implemented for \emph{tree} automata in library VATA. Description
of this library will be placed in next section.

\begin{comment}
For finite automata manipulation exists many different libraries. Libraries have different purposes and are implemented in different languages, 
e.g. established package of Java \emph{dk.brics.automaton} \cite{brics}, \cite{tacas10}, which is also reimplemented for C in \emph{libfa} \cite{libfa} 
and for C\# in \emph{Fare} \cite{fare}. Another libraries are \emph{The RWTH FSA toolkit} \cite{rwth} in C++, which also supports weighted automata, or
\emph{FSA Utilities toolbox} \cite{fsaprolog} in Prolog.

This is not definitely complete enumeration of finite automata libraries, but just few examples. Their main problem is that they do not contain 
the efficient inclusion testing. On the other side, new efficient algorithms introduced in \cite{cav06,tacas10} and in \cite{popl13} have been for finite automata
implemented only in OCaml and implementation in C++ could be much more efficient.

Because of these reasons, algorithms for finite automata manipulation will be implemented as extension of VATA (library for tree automata manipulation) in C++.
\end{comment}

\section{VATA library}
\label{VATA}
\subsection{General}
VATA is a highly efficient open source library for manipulating \emph{non-deterministic tree} automata licensed under GPL, version 3. 
Main application of VATA is in formal verification.
VATA library is implemented in C++ and uses the Boost C++ library. Download of library can be found on its website 
\footnote{\url{http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/verifit/tools/libvata/}} \cite{libvata}.  

Purposes of VATA library are similar like purposes of this work, so it was decided not to creating brand new library, but makes extension of VATA library
for finite automata.

\subsection{Design}
\label{sectionDesignVata}
VATA provides two kind of encoding for tree automata -- Explicit Encoding (top-down) and Semi-symbolic encoding (top-down and bottom-up). The main difference
between encoding is
in data structure for storing transition of \emph{tree} automata. Semi-symbolic encoding is primary for automata with large alphabets. 

As you
can see on picture \ref{picVataDesign}, VATA is written in modular way, so it is easy to make extension for finite automata. Thanks to the modularity, 
any new encoding can share other parts of library like parser or serializer \cite{libvata}.

VATA library supports now just \emph{Timbuk} format as input format of \emph{tree} automata \cite{timbuk}.

		\label{picVataDesign}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

%%TODO: Vic se rozkecat o kodovanich
\subsubsection{Explicit Encoding}
\label{sectionExplicitEnc}
For storing explicit encoding top-down transitions (transitions are in form $q \xrightarrow{a} (q_1,...,q_n)$) 
is used \emph{hierarchical data structure based on hash tables}. First level of look-up
table maps the states to \emph{transition cluster}. This clusters are also look-up table and maps symbols of input alphabet
to the set of pointers (stored as \emph{red-black tree}) to tuples of states. Storing tuples of states is of course very memory demanding, so special
designed hash table was used for storing them. Inserting new transition to this structure requires a constant number of steps (exception is worst case scenario)
\cite{libvata}. 

For better performance is used \emph{copy-on-write} technique \cite{libvata}. The principle of this technique is, 
that on copy of automaton is created just new pointer to transition table of original automaton and after adding new state to one automaton (original or
copy) is modified only part of the shared transition table. 
\subsubsection{Semi-symbolic Encoding}
Transition functions in semi-symbolic encoding are stored in \emph{multi-terminal binary decision diagrams} (MTBDD), which are extension of \emph{binary decision 
diagrams}. There are provided top-down (transitions are in form $q \xrightarrow{a} (q_1,...,q_n)$, for $a$ with arity $n$) 
and bottom-up (transitions are in form $(q_1,...,q_n)\xrightarrow{a}q$) representation of tree automata in semi-symbolic encoding. 
Interesting is saving of symbols in MTBDD. In top-down encoding, the input
symbols are stored in MTBDD with their arity, because we need to be able to distinguish between two instances of same symbols with different arity.
In opposite case, bottom-up encoding does not need to store arity, because it is possible to get it from arity of tuple on left side of transition \cite{libvata}.

For purposes of VATA library was implemented new MTBDD package, which improved the performance of library.

%TODO povypravaet o MTBDD package

\subsubsection{Operations}
There are supported basic operations like union, intersection, elimination of unreachable states, but also some advance algorithms for inclusion checking, 
computation of simulation relation, language preserving size reduction based on simulation equivalence. 

For inclusion testing are implemented optimized algorithms from \cite{cav06,tacas10}. The inclusion operation is implemented in more versions, so it is possible
to use only some heuristic and compare different results.

Efficiency of advanced operations does not come only from the usage of efficient algorithms, 
but there are also some implementation optimization like \emph{copy-on-write}
principle for automata copying (briefly described in subsection \ref{sectionExplicitEnc}), buffering once computed clusters of transitions etc. 
Other optimization could be found in exploitation of polymorphism using C++ function templates, instead of
virtual method, because look-up in virtual-method table is very expensive \cite{libvata}.
More details about implementation optimization could be found in \cite{libvata}.

Especially advanced operations are able only for specific encoding. Some of operations implemented in VATA library and their supported encodings are in this table:
\begin{savenotes}
\begin{table}[h]

		\end{tabular}
	\caption{Table of some supported operations}
	\label{tab1}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
\end{savenotes}


\subsection{Extension for Finite Automata}
This work creates extension of VATA library for finite automata in explicit encoding. The main goal is provide operation for language inclusion test of
NFA without need of explicit determinisation. To be precise, VATA library could be already used for finite automata, 
which can be represented like one dimensional
\emph{tree} automata. But VATA library data structures for manipulating \emph{tree} automata are designated for more complex data structures
and new special implementation for finite
automata will be definitely more efficient. This new extension will use some existing interfaces like simulation computation.
